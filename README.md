# JavaScript Runtime Performance Comparison

This project compares the execution speed of **Node.js**, **Deno**, and **Bun** using the same JavaScript code.

The tests include both CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks:

-   Recursive Fibonacci calculation
-   Prime number generation
-   Reading and writing text files (from small sizes up to 500 MB)

## Requirements

-   Latest versions of **Node.js**, **Deno**, and **Bun**
-   A Windows or macOS/Linux system
-   The test text files (for I/O experiments)
